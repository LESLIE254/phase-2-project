# Phase 2 Independent Project

## Description 
My project is titled Contact App Manager. My app is a contact manager that one can be able to store, add, search and remove a contact.</br>
Th einformation users can store on my site include:
* Name of a contact
* Physical address of someone
* Telephone/mobile number
* Also one is able to store an email address


My project is a single page application developed using create-react-app. It also has over 5 react components. </br>
My project also includes client-side routing to make the experince more dynamic.</br>
I also use Json-server to create a RESTful API for my back-end. </br>
I do not use an external API to obtain my data but instead store my data locally in a db.json file.<br>
I deployed my backend on heroku and my frontend on netlify.<br>
